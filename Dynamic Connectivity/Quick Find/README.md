This algorithm depicts a problem that if we are having N numbers and we start connecting numbers with one another then if we want to check whether the given two numbers are connected or not(directly or inderictly) dirctly connected means: if 1 in connected to 5 then it means, 1 and 5 are directly connected with each other. indirctly connected means: if 1 in connected to 5 and 5 is connected to 9 and further 9 is connectd to 3 then it means, 1 and 3 are indirectly connected with each other.
